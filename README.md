# PhDWriter

## Installation
This version of PhDWriter requires NodeJS to be installed.

Install from http://nodejs.org/

Once NodeJS is installed, run the following commands to complete the "installation" progress:

	npm install
	
node_modules is ignored in .gitignore, this is to avoid cross-compatibility issues across machines and OSes. 

The application also requires mongodb to be installed.

Once everything is up and running, use the following command to launch the server:

	node app.js

You can also use nodemon, which will restart the server automatically when changes are made to the source files.


## Coding Guidelines
1. Use tabs, not spaces to indent
2. Each tab should be of width 4
